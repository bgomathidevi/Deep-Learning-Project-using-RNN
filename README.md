IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project is a Streamlit web application that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using a pre-trained RNN model on the IMDB dataset.

The model used in this project is a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an embedding layer, trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The model architecture is as follows:

Model Architecture

Embedding Layer:
Function: This layer maps the input sequence of word indices (integer representations of words) into dense vectors of fixed size.
Description: Each word in the input sequence is represented by an integer index. The embedding layer converts these indices into dense vectors of a fixed dimension, which can capture semantic information about the words. This helps the neural network to understand the context and relationships between words. For instance, words with similar meanings will have similar vector representations.
Output: The output of this layer is a sequence of dense vectors, one for each word in the input sequence.

SimpleRNN Layer:
Function: This layer processes the sequence of dense vectors generated by the embedding layer.
Description: The SimpleRNN layer is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) layer that processes sequential data one element at a time while maintaining an internal state that captures information about the past elements in the sequence. This allows the network to learn patterns and dependencies in the data over time. In the context of movie reviews, this layer can help capture the flow and context of the review text.
Output: The output is a single hidden state vector that encapsulates the information from the entire input sequence.

Dense Layer:
Function: This layer produces the final output for the binary classification task.
Description: The Dense layer is a fully connected layer that takes the hidden state vector from the SimpleRNN layer as input and applies a linear transformation followed by a sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid activation function outputs a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the positive class. In this case, it indicates whether the review is positive or negative.
Output: The final output is a single value (between 0 and 1), which is interpreted as the probability of the review being positive. A value closer to 1 indicates a positive review, while a value closer to 0 indicates a negative review.
